Phase 1
- User Management: We now have a system in place to create and manage user accounts.
- Bid Management: The application can handle and record bids from users.
- API Integration: Both user and bid functionalities have been integrated and tested to ensure smooth operation.
 http://localhost:8080/api/bids
 http://localhost:8080/api/register 
 body raw and json and when we ask for the bids amount just replace it with the object id .


 Phase 2
 Implemented User Management: Allows creating and managing users in the system.
Implemented Bid Management: Handles bids placed on requests, including tracking amounts and associated users.
Implemented Contract Creation: Facilitates creating contracts once a bid is accepted, with initial support for setting contract status and linking to requests and bids.
 http://localhost:8080/api/contracts

 Phase 3 
  - So here is the coclusion here we have created the things .e have developed a centralized application that integrates a frontend interface with a backend API. The frontend includes forms for creating users, bids, and contracts. The backend, built with Go, handles API requests to manage user accounts, bid submissions, and contract creation. The backend serves static frontend files and processes data using MongoDB. Users can interact with the application through a simple web interface, and data is stored and managed effectively in the database.

 Phase 4  
 -  This will include the modification and further development of the things .
